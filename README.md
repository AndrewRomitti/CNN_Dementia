# Dementia Doctor (CNN Code)
This is a colab notebook that uses a Convolutional Neural Network from the FastAI Library in order to diagnose 4 classes of Dementia from MRI Scans

Dementia Doctor is a project I undertook my junior year of high school where a friend and I developed a software that helped diagnose Dementia from MRI scans. The project was selected as one of the winners of the 2022 Congressional App Challenge.

Due to file corruption, I lost the code to the front and backend of the software, but I still have the google colab of the model that was used to diagnose dementia and this is the repo for that.
